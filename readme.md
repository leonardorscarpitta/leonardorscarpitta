### üìë **Sobre mim**:
- I was born In 2005, started my studies In a Bacharel Software Engineer course, have always liked getting involved with technology and at the end of 2023 I decided that this would be the area in which I would work, I am and will always be willing to update myself on new market trends and I am a person who easily accepts criticism, looking to evolve each more and more as a person and professional.
- Despite the Software Developer goal, I have a good knowledge In agile methodologies such as Scrum!
